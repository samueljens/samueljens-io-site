## About Me

{{< figure class="avatar" src="/avatar.jpg" >}}


Hello and welcome,

I am a third-year PhD student in the Department of Political Science at Stony Brook University in Stony Brook, NY. My research interests are in American political behavior, political psychology, and legislative behavior. 

Please view my blog for recent projects and analyses regarding politics and American life.

I am originally from NYC, but I moved around growing up having lived in Austin, TX and northern VA. I attended the College of William & Mary and earned my BA in Psychology (with Honors) and Government before attending Stony Brook University to earn my MA in Political Science.

Outside of school, I enjoy cycling and mountain biking. I also love listening to music, attending ballet and modern dance performances, and watching GT3/multi-class racing. Go Team Bentley!
